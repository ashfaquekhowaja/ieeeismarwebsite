Haptic feedback for XR interaction is often limited to vibrotactile cues provided at the hand-held controller level; however, touch sensation is crucial in all those applications where digital interaction relies on users\u2019 intuition and manipulative tasks. In this sense, the integration and intersection between Haptics and XR promises to achieve interesting scenarios and more efficient solutions, as well as opportunities for academic and industrial advancements. However, there are significant open challenges in this domain, related to hardware as well as software technologies. This half day online tutorial aims to provide the audience with an overview of how research and industrial case scenarios related to haptics connect to challenges and opportunities proposed by the integration with XR technologies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/view\/ismar-24-tutorial\/home\">Call for Participation\ud83d\udd17<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-accent-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-80dbbbd0c6c1acc5ad1389311f83def5\">T2 &#8211; Cybersickness: Understanding the Challenge and Building Solutions with Standardized Benchmarks<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Organizers:<\/strong><br>Bernhard Riecke, Behrang Keshavarz and Rose Rouhani<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Abstract:<\/strong><br>This half-day tutorial will provide a comprehensive overview of cybersickness in virtual reality (VR). It will cover the definition, symptoms, and impact of cyber\u00acsickness, as well as the leading theories and factors that influence it. The tutorial will also introduce a novel, open-source cyber-sickness benchmark system designed to standardize the assessment and mitigation of cyber-sickness. Attendees will learn how to use the benchmark to evaluate VR experiences and mitigation techniques, and will have the opportunity to participate in an interactive workshop to discuss potential improvements and future directions for the benchmark.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/ispace.iat.sfu.ca\/project\/cybersickness-tutorial-ismar2024\/\">Call for Participation\ud83d\udd17<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-accent-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0959fced861f979c7be8e10a9ee6c338\" id=\"test-anchor-1\">T3 &#8211; Participating in the Testing of VERA<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Organizers:<\/strong><br>Ali Haskins Lisle and Greg Welch<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Abstract:<\/strong><br>The&nbsp;Virtual Experience Research Accelerator&nbsp;(VERA)&nbsp;is currently undergoing development, but by&nbsp;ISMAR 2024&nbsp;we expect to have an early version of the system available for the running of real or realistic user studies, for the purpose of testing the VERA systems and procedures. On 21 Oct 2024 we will conduct an&nbsp;ISMAR 2024&nbsp;tutorial to introduce attendees to the requirements and procedures for getting involved in such testing, what we expect in terms of tester effort, and what we expect in terms of test system functionality. We will update this website with materials relevant to the tutorial prior to the conference, so that we may use the in-person setting to focus on demos, adapting studies, and discussion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sreal.ucf.edu\/vera\/ismar2024_tutorial\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/sreal.ucf.edu\/vera\/ismar2024_tutorial\/\">Call for Participation\ud83d\udd17<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:85px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-accent-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-853c71bf55b6ddb4f6bc77583163d224\"><\/h5>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>T1 &#8211; Enabling Haptic Interaction in Extended Reality: the challenges, the directions, the opportunities Organizers:Francesco Chinello, Nikhil Deshpande and Konstantinos Koumaditis Abstract:Despite extended reality (XR) technologies\u2019 accessibility, widespread success, and significant industrial effort in research and development, most of the interactions between XR\u2019s digital artefacts and the users still rely [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"page-templates\/template-fullwidth.php","meta":{"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-618","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/618","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=618"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/618\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":953,"href":"https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/618\/revisions\/953"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=618"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
