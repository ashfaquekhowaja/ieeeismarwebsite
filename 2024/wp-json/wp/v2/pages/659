As such, ISMAR is calling for friendly and responsive volunteers to help us with the 2024 edition of this conference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteers help by being the friendly, helpful and hard-working face of the event, taking on frontline tasks such as; managing the registration desk, helping set up demo sessions, providing on-site support to the organizing committee, assisting speakers during presentations, supporting as virtual event moderators, providing session support to virtual attendees, and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As last year, ISMAR 2024 will be hosted in hybrid mode. Therefore, while our volunteers will all be on-site, their tasks may include opportunities in both modalities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why You Should Volunteer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t know how to start a conversation with that Professor you read every paper from? It\u2019s easier when you have to register and welcome them to the conference!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participating as a student volunteer gives you unique networking opportunities with our attendees, from young local and international researchers to world leaders in mixed and augmented reality. Volunteering for ISMAR 2024 is also an opportunity to gain academic service experience \u2013an often-critical component of post graduate work\u2013, and valuable hands-on experience for future scientific event organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phrased differently, this is an opportunity to help shape the events of an international conference!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the experience, we recognize your time and effort contributions (see Expectations below) to delivering a smooth event by waiving your conference registration fee. Students also receive the same benefits as other conference attendees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Important note: The registration fee waiver for student volunteers cannot be used to register a publication. If you are selected as a student volunteer, and your work has been accepted for presentation at ISMAR 2024, one of your co-authors must register for the conference and pay the author registration fee.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Selection Guidelines and Eligibility<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We encourage all undergraduate or postgraduate students with a keen interest in cutting edge virtual, mixed and augmented reality research to apply. Further, submissions help us, the Committee, gain valuable feedback on our processes and the Student experience that may inform future events. However, we acknowledge that Student Volunteer positions are often highly competitive as we receive many strong applications every year for the limited available positions so do not be disheartened if you are not selected.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To join the ISMAR team as a volunteer you must be enrolled as a PhD, Masters, or full-time undergraduate student at the time of the conference (October 21-25, 2024). A proportion of positions will be prioritized for international students traveling from outside the North America region to present their research, but all applicants are welcome (even if they are not presenting).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following additional considerations will influence volunteer selection:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Selection for presentation at ISMAR 2024.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Preference is given to PhD, then masters, then undergraduate students.
