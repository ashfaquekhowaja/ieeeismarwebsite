ISMAR offers three distinct calls for journal papers, conference papers, and posters. This call is for submission to the poster track. See the ISMAR website for more information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ISMAR has responded to the increasing commercial and research activities related to AR, VR, and MR by expanding its scope over the past several years. ISMAR 2024 will cover the full range of technologies encompassed by the MR continuum, from interfaces in the real world to fully immersive experiences.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We invite research contributions that advance AR\/VR\/MR technologies, collectively called eXtended Reality (XR) technologies, and are relevant to the community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The poster session is one of the highlights of ISMAR, where the community discusses the benefits and challenges of XR in other research and application domains. Presenting a poster is a fantastic opportunity to receive feedback on research that has not been published and to present finished incremental research outputs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-accent-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2164c305ae3d03d1391778e8a416facf\">Important Deadlines<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Poster Paper Submission Deadline: <em><s>July 19, 2024<\/s><\/em> <strong><em>updated<\/em>: July 21, 2024<\/strong> <strong>(23:59 AoE, Sunday)<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Notification: <strong>August 18, 2024<\/strong> <strong>(23:59 AoE, Sunday)<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Camera-ready version: <strong>August 23, 2024<\/strong> <strong>(23:59 AoE, Friday)<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-accent-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6cf7e5e8d6a8ca0bfbc4a7b59cddfee4\">Submission Details<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Regular Papers<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We welcome anonymous paper submissions of <strong>2 pages <\/strong>(including the list of references) in the VGTC conference template. Detailed submission guidelines are available <a href=\"https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/submission-guidelines-for-ismar-poster-papers\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"384\">here<\/a>. Poster papers will be reviewed based on the extended abstract, which can contain smaller contributions, late-breaking developments, or in-progress work. ISMAR considers poster papers of 2 pages to be non-archival. This means that authors of 2-page poster papers can resubmit longer versions of their accepted work, with additional details, at later ISMAR conferences. All paper submissions must be in English.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All submissions will be accepted or rejected as poster papers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>All accepted poster papers will be archived in the IEEE Xplore digital library<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>All accepted poster papers will be subject to the registration and publication processing policy of ISMAR 2024.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h.dz3emn9fos73\">Conference Papers Recommended for Poster Track<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Poster track is co-aligned with the Conference Paper track, which may accept some Conference Paper submissions as posters based on the merit of their contribution.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conference papers that have been recommended for posters should be shortened to a length of 2-4 pages (including references). Please note that ISMAR considers poster papers of 3+ pages to be archival. This means that authors of 3+-page poster papers cannot resubmit longer versions of their accepted work at later ISMAR conferences. All paper submissions must be in English.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-accent-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-d7f8e1ca1aa82cbd0c21651e2485c188\">Topics of Interest<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All topics relevant to and advancing AR, VR, and MR are interesting.
