Journal paper submissions must not have been previously published. A manuscript is considered to have been previously published if it has appeared in a peer-reviewed or non-reviewed periodical or proceedings that is permanently available in print or electronic form to non-attendees, regardless of the language of that publication. A paper identical or substantially similar in content (in its entirety or in part) to one submitted to ISMAR should not be simultaneously under consideration for another conference or journal during any part of the ISMAR review process, from the submission deadline until notifications of decisions are emailed to authors. In some situations, a submission may be built upon prior work. To fully explain the relationship between the submitted paper and prior work, authors are asked to provide the related papers as well as an anonymous letter of explanation that highlights the significant changes or advances; these materials will only be seen by the Primary reviewer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b18aba72ea32f71fc2cdcbb6d7eaa6f2\"><br><strong>Completeness. <\/strong>The submission must include all information necessary to evaluate the paper and must not ask reviewers to go to web sites or other external information sources, since that might circumvent page and media format limits, and may jeopardize the anonymity of the reviewers.

Videos must be submitted according to the instructions at the submission website. When submitted as supporting material, videos must be free of any identifying information prior to reviewing as per the double-blind submission policy. Authors submitting a video should also include a text file describing the codec used to encode the video. Videos should be playable with standard software on PCs, Macs, and Linux machines. If the reviewers cannot play the video, it may reduce the chances of the submission being accepted.<br><br><strong>Review Duties for Authors.<\/strong> Due to the increasing numbers of submissions to ISMAR, we rely on many reviewers who are willing to provide expert opinions. To expand the reviewer pool and promote community integrity, the senior author\/principal investigator will be required to register to review up to three papers through PCS at the time of submission. Additionally, senior authors are encouraged to ask experienced junior authors to register in PCS to review papers and mentor them in the review process.<br><br><strong>Ethics and Responsibility.<\/strong> All submissions describing research experiments with human participants must follow the appropriate ethical guidelines as imposed by your affiliation, and authors are required to secure and report their approval by the relevant ethics commission, if applicable. An approval by any ethical review board needs to be indicated via the submission system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Submission Requirements:<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Papers must be strictly formatted according to <a href=\"https:\/\/tc.computer.org\/vgtc\/publications\/journal\/\">IEEE VGTC submission guidelines<\/a> and submitted electronically as PDF documents.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>ISMAR 2024 journal paper track uses a double-blind reviewing process (see Reviewing Process below). Thus, authors, affiliations, and acknowledgments must not be mentioned in the submitted paper.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Papers must be written in English.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Submissions must not be under&nbsp;review&nbsp;by any other conference, journal or other publication venue during ISMAR\u2019s reviewing period, and must not be previously published or accepted for publication elsewhere. This includes publications that have previously appeared in languages other than English. ISMAR actively searches for duplicate submissions by exchanging author and title lists with other conferences and journals. Such submissions will be rejected without review, and the coordinators of the duplicate submission will be notified.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>ISMAR asks the senior author of each paper to volunteer to review three other papers submitted to ISMAR. We leave it to the authors to determine which of them is the senior author. Note that, regardless of the number of submissions on which an author appears, we only ask them to be willing to review three other ISMAR papers. The senior author should register as a reviewer with the ISMAR Precision Conference System (<a href=\"https:\/\/new.precisionconference.com\/ismar24b\/\">PCS<\/a>).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Authors may include supplementary materials with the submission. Supplemental material can include videos, proofs, code, experimental data, appendices, audio files, and other files that supplement the paper. These materials will be included on the conference thumb drive, as well as archived in the IEEE Digital Library. A pointer to the supplemental material should be included in the text of the paper. Supplemental material may not be used to extend page limits; the paper itself must completely describe the research and results.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Videos should not be longer than five minutes, and the total size of all submitted materials (including the PDF document) must be under 50MB; but 100MB can be granted if requested by authors. Authors submitting a video should also include a text file describing the codec used to encode the video. Videos should be playable with standard software on PCs, Macs, and Linux machines. If the reviewers cannot play the video, it may reduce the chances of the submission being accepted.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The submission must include all information necessary to evaluate the paper and must not ask reviewers to go to web sites or other external information sources, since that might circumvent page and media format limits, and may jeopardize the anonymity of the reviewers. Such external sites will not be accessed during the review process.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>For accepted papers, at least one author must register for the conference and present the work according to ISMAR registration and publication processing policy published on the website. If no author is fully registered by the camera-ready submission deadline, the accepted work will be withdrawn from publication.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Double-Blind Process and Anonymity Policy:<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ISMAR uses a DOUBLE-BLIND review process. This means that both the authors and the reviewers must remain anonymous to each other. Submissions (including citations and optional videos) must not contain information that identifies the authors, their institutions, funding sources, or their places of work. Relevant previous work by the authors must be cited in the third person to preserve anonymity. Authors that have questions\/issues around the double-blind submission policy should contact the conference Program Chairs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the reviewers may recognize the submission authors based on information available online, the following are considered violations of the review process if they occur during the review process, i.e., from 30 days before the submission deadline till the submission is officially accepted (final version approved), or the authors are notified that the submission is rejected:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"1\">\n<li>Listing ISMAR submissions or prepublications (ArXiv, institutional tech reports, \u2026) of these submissions on authors\u2019 individual or institutional webpages.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Generating any publicity for the submitted works via university or company PR teams or channels.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Publicizing the submitted work in external talks (unless it is a job talk).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Generating any publicity for the submitted works via authors\u2019 individual or institutional social media channels or other forms of media. This includes publishing any types of interviews with editors\/journalists\/writers\/interviewers of newspapers, radio, television, or magazines, as well as public relations and media arms of companies, universities, and other research institutions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Publicly replying or acknowledging authorship in response to any social media posts by others regarding the submitted work.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Creating public code or data repositories corresponding to the submission that allow determining the author\u2019s identity (e.g., by listing the author name, or through the username).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the above principles, the following are NOT considered a violation of the review process rules, if the respective conditions are satisfied:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"1\">\n<li>Archiving the submission (to get a timestamp) as an institutional tech report, or a preprint on ArXiv or a similar service, before or after the submission deadline is allowed. However, the submission webpage or manuscript should not state anywhere that the submission is under review for ISMAR. It should not include the submission ID or use the IEEE VGTC conference format (this refers to conference name, copyright, etc., not to the choice of fonts, margins, or column layout).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unlisted YouTube videos linked to an ArXiv submission are allowed. Such videos should not include submission IDs or author information.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Anonymous code or data repositories, i.e., ones where the author\u2019s identity cannot be determined through username or other means, either stand-alone or linked to an ArXiv submission, are allowed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Authors can privately reply to submission-related queries submitted via social media. The replies should not be publicly visible.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If a potential violation of any of these guidelines is discovered, the case will be discussed by the Primary and Secondary review coordinators and Program Chairs, who will determine if a violation has occurred and if, consequently, the paper in question should be desk rejected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Submission Process:<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All materials will be submitted electronically through the Precision Conference website at:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/\/new.precisionconference.com\/ismar24b\/__;!!Bt8RZUm9aw!-Rm21WRuD1Y5fVHeXAhfUqtR_ezoepWEYTo-AV4g0eaPGs0JkmXMB63bc0hhwO4CB-YvaEt04KNjYEPi$\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/new.precisionconference.com\/ismar24b\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you already have an account with that system, please use that account to submit your materials.

After receiving the reviews, authors may submit a rebuttal to address the reviewers\u2019 comments.

It is not intended to add new contributions (theorems, algorithms, experiments) that were not included in the original submission.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Primary will check the rebuttal and review quality and initiate the discussion with the Secondary and the external reviewers. They will read the rebuttal, the reviews, and anonymously discuss the paper.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Initial recommendation: The Primary will ask the reviewers to agree on one recommendation (accept, conditional accept as a paper, or reject). If there is no consensual decision between Primary, Secondary, and external reviewers, the Primary and Secondary will discuss a recommendation and if inconclusive, an additional review can be requested from another ISMAR Program Committee member.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>After the discussion phase, the Primary will write a meta-review that states the initial recommendation.

Each submission will be reviewed by one member of the Program Committee (the Secondary, not the Primary) and two external reviewers. Each reviewer will be asked to submit a written assessment along with an initial recommendation to accept or reject the paper.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The initial reviews will be released to the paper authors. After receiving the reviews, authors may submit a rebuttal to address the reviewers\u2019 comments. The author rebuttal is meant to provide an opportunity to rebut factual errors or to supply additional information requested by the reviewers. It is not intended to add new contributions (theorems, algorithms, experiments) that were not included in the original submission.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Primary will check the rebuttal and review quality and initiate the discussion with the Secondary and the external reviewers. They will read the rebuttal, the reviews, and anonymously discuss the paper.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Initial recommendation: The Primary will ask the reviewers to agree on one recommendation (accept, conditional accept as a paper, or reject). If there is no consensual decision between Primary, Secondary, and external reviewers, the Primary and Secondary will discuss a recommendation and if inconclusive, an additional review can be requested from another ISMAR Program Committee member.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>After the discussion phase, the Primary will write a meta-review that states the initial recommendation. The final decision of the ISMAR Program Committee will rely on this meta-review.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The ISMAR Program Chairs will decide, based on the recommendation, if a paper is accepted, conditionally accepted, or rejected.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the case the paper is accepted or conditionally accepted, a shepherd will be assigned to the paper (usually the Primary) who assists the authors in preparing the final paper and who verifies that the authors comply with all conditions (if applicable).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In case the paper is rejected, continue to read the poster review details.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Handling of rejected papers and recommendations as posters:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case a conference paper submission is rejected, the ISMAR Program Chairs will coordinate with the poster track and its committee to conditionally accept a paper as a poster. The submissions will be handled as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The Primary will be asked to recommend the paper for the poster track or to reject it (from both conference paper and poster tracks). The Program Chairs will consider this recommendation and make the final decision.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If the paper has a recommendation for the poster track, the Poster Chairs and committee will receive all the reviews and the meta-review generated during the conference paper review process. The Poster Chairs may also decide to discuss questions with the Primary.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Based on this information, the poster track committee will either conditionally accept the paper as a poster or reject the contribution.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the case the contribution is accepted as a poster, a shepherd will be assigned to the paper, who assists the authors in preparing a poster contribution.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Invited Conference Papers from the Journal Track:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Papers submitted to the journal track which at the initial decision stage are being recommended for rejection but are deemed to be of significant quality to warrant potential presentation at the conference, may be invited to re-submit to the conference paper track. The review process for this will follow the key stages of the conference papers however where possible, reviewer continuity from the journal track will be maintained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best Paper Awards:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program committee creates a list of the best accepted papers. There is no set size limit for this list. The program chairs then forward this list to the Best Paper Awards Committee, which is organized separately from the program committee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also see the Reviewing Guidelines for more information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"COMMON\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-accent-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-921b5496e07e519c2b7048d71e4cf25f\"><strong>General Guidelines for both Journal Papers and Conference Papers<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Plagiarism Check:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note that all submissions will be checked for plagiarism using IEEE Crosscheck.

As an author, you should ask yourself the following questions while writing your paper. Submissions that do not provide good answers to these questions are unlikely to be accepted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a><\/a><strong>What problem are you addressing?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common motivation for publishing a paper is to present a solution to a problem. When doing so, try to state all your constraints and assumptions. This is an area where it can be invaluable to have someone who is not intimately familiar with your work read the paper. Include a crisp description of the problem in the abstract and try to suggest it in the title. Note that the Program Chairs depend almost completely on the abstract and title when they determine which Program Committee member to assign to the paper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ISMAR papers often focus on a certain aspect of Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, or Virtual Reality systems. The following list includes some example topics but does not represent an exhaustive list of all topics. We welcome any new idea beyond the usual range of areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Interaction Methods: Does the paper propose a novel interaction method? Does it present different use cases and applications for it? Can it demonstrate that the method performs better than other known ones?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>User Interface &amp; Human Factors: Does the paper describe how Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, or Virtual Reality is improving a user interface design, human task performance or perception?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tracking and Pose Estimation: Does the paper describe a novel method that is more robust in difficult conditions (lighting, outdoor, fast motion)? Is it a new, clever combination of different sensors? Does it provide more information for use in interaction and rendering?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rendering and Visualization: Does the paper describe a novel, improved method for realistic integration of virtual graphics into a mixed scene? Is it faster or more accurate than known methods? Does it present a novel way of presenting information about the real world?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Displays and Input Devices: Does the paper describe a novel display (e.g., visual, or aural)? Does it describe a novel input device that provides different input modalities, is easier to use and deploy or more precise?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Applications: Is the paper proposing a new application of Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, or Virtual Reality in a specific domain? Are you providing a new understanding of usage patterns and social behavior of a deployed application? Mind that an application has a use case in a target domain; it is not just an implementation of software.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a><\/a><strong>What were the previous approaches?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the relevant published works in your problem area? What deficiencies in their approaches are you trying to overcome? How does the new approach differ from previously published results? Do not expect the reviewers to know this information without telling them in the paper, as they are unlikely to remember the precise details of all the relevant literature. Make specific comparisons between your work and that described in the references; do not just compile a list of vaguely related papers. What are the limitations of your work and is the future work still to be addressed?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a><\/a><strong>How well did you address your stated problem?<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on your problem statement, what did you accomplish? You are responsible for arguing that the problem is sufficiently addressed. Include pictures, statistics, or whatever is required to make your case. If you find this part of the paper difficult to write, perhaps the work is not yet finished, and the paper should be deferred until next year. (And, perhaps, submitted as a poster this year).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following describes some typical evaluation methods for different kinds of papers. This list is not exhaustive but provides some hints as to what can help to present your contribution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Interaction Methods: Did you measure how usable the method or system is? What is the performance of users (e.g. completion time, error rate, learning curve) compared to a previous interface developed for a similar task?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>User Interface &amp; Human Factors: Is the improvement or effect described well supported through evaluations? Was the experimental design appropriate to your solution? Were sample size, statistical evaluation, and presentation and conclusions appropriate? Were sample sizes diverse and representative of all intended users?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tracking and Pose Estimation: What opportunity does the method contribute to the Augmented\/Mixed\/Virtual Reality domain? How does it compare to known state-of-the-art systems? Can your system maintain competitive robustness\/reliability? Can it deal with difficult input including light conditions, fast motion, occlusions? How fast is it and on which hardware? It is also a good idea to use a standard data set to make the results comparable to other publications or make your test data sets available for other authors.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rendering and Visualization: Is the output quality of your system superior to previous methods? Is it faster or capable of operating at real-time rates? What hardware and sensors does it require? For visualization, what use cases does it cover? What amount or complexity of data can it deal with?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Displays and Input Devices: What are the performance specifications of the display? For example, for a visual display does it work indoor\/outdoor, strong light conditions, what is the field of view, and is it multi-user capable? What is the hardware\/software required to recreate it? What are the specifications of the input device? Can it be used in a mobile setting?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Applications: How did you design the application, what constraints from the application domain are essential? Was the system tested by end users that are representative of the intended population in the application domain? Did it affect a relevant factor, i.e. performance, safety? Did it create opportunities to improve the work methods?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a><\/a><strong>What does this work contribute to the field?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are your new ideas or results? If you do not have at least one new idea, you do not have a publishable paper. Can your results be applied anywhere outside of your project? If not, the paper is probably too special purpose for ISMAR. On the other hand, beware of trying to write a paper with too large a scope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a><\/a><strong>Is the paper complete?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question that generates a large amount of discussion within the Program Committee is to determine whether a paper is complete. If the paper presents an algorithm or technique, an experienced practitioner in the field should be able to implement it using the paper and its references. If the paper claims to present a faster or more efficient way of implementing an established technique, it must contain enough detail to replicate the experiment on competing implementations. When you quote numbers, be sure that they are not misleading state clearly whether they were measured, simulated, or derived, and how you did the measurements, simulations, or derivations. For example, CPU time measurements are meaningless unless the reader is told the machine and configuration on which they were obtained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a><\/a><strong>Does the paper present too much information?<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many large, poorly written papers contain a good paper trying to get out. It is the author\u2019s responsibility, not the reviewer\u2019s, to discover this paper and turn it into the submission. If you have addressed a single, practical problem, do not try to generalize it for the purposes of publication. If you have a formal theory or elaborate architecture, do not include all the vagaries of the implementation unless they are critical to the utility of the theory. Do not include the contents of your user\u2019s manual; instead, describe the model or functionality achieved. You should assume your audience has a working knowledge of user-interface development and access to the major journals in computer science, electrical engineering, and psychology. A short conference paper can only present a few concise ideas well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a><\/a><strong>Can this paper be presented well?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While ISMAR papers are judged primarily as technical papers, some consideration is given to how suitable the topic is for a conference presentation. Think of how you would present your ideas, and how big the audience is likely to be. Papers that have a small number of concisely stated new ideas and that are visually interesting tend to appeal to a large audience and be easy to present. As recent conferences clearly show, these criteria do not eliminate papers that have taxonomies or strong theoretical content, or appeal to a specialized audience, if they contain significant new ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a><\/a><strong>Should a video also be included?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A video can be very helpful for communicating technical results, especially when the paper discusses an interaction technique. However, do not try to save space in the paper by putting essential information into the video. The paper must stand on its own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a><\/a><strong>Is the paper accessible?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All information, including information in figures, charts, tables, etc., should be available to readers who consume it in different ways. For example: some of us cannot see color, some read papers as a monochrome printout, some use low-contrast displays, and some listen to the content instead of seeing it. <a href=\"https:\/\/chi2021.acm.org\/for-authors\/presenting\/papers\/guide-to-an-accessible-submission\">CHI 2021<\/a> has useful information on making a paper accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a><\/a><strong>Is the paper using gender neutral language?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use \u201che\u201d when referring to men or boys. Use \u201cshe\u201d when referring to women or girls. Avoid phrases such as \u201che\/she\u201d or \u201che or she\u201d when a gender is not clearly known. Instead use \u201cthey\u201d as a gender-neutral pronoun. When referencing a profession, use the gender-neutral form. For example, use fire fighter, police officer, or worker instead of fireman, policeman, or workman.

Furthermore, the ismar.net website lists past best paper awards, which are good examples of great ISMAR papers.
