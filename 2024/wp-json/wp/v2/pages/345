The workshops will be scheduled on October 21st (Monday) and October 25th (Friday) and can be conducted in person, online, or in hybrid mode, in alignment with the ISMAR conference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ISMAR workshops provide a platform for presenting novel work, work in progress, and position papers. The workshops bring together researchers, developers, technology providers, practitioners, and users for an in-depth and interactive discussion of important \/ emerging issues in augmented, mixed, and virtual reality through an informal yet thought-provoking exchange of ideas and information. We encourage workshops that go beyond the \u201cmini-conferences\u201d format of organization and promote interactive discussions among presenters and participants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The workshops may target a specific application area, research area, or topic of general interest to the ISMAR community. The scope of the workshop should align with the main conference topics. For more details, please visit the conference website at <a href=\"https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/\">https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We envision the workshops as launch pads to propel the ISMAR community forward in specific research directions, build a sub-community around shared research interests, and build bridges between ISMAR and other research communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Workshop proposals must be submitted before May 13th, 2024 (23:59 AoE, Monday). A committee will review the workshop proposals and notify the organizing team of acceptance by May 24th, 2024.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-accent-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-8942dd5365d1a3914a4b6d6da3247a52\">Important Dates<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Workshop proposal deadline: May 13th, 2024 (23:59 AoE, Monday)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Workshop acceptance notification: May 24th, 2024 (Friday)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Workshop calls for participation issued by: June 3rd, 2024 (Monday)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Workshop acceptance notification to participants issued by: August 12th, 2024 (Monday)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Camera-ready materials: August 26th, 2024 (Monday)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-accent-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9619d26c32cc72834079e301b4261f75\">Workshop Format<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>ISMAR workshops may be organized in different formats.&nbsp; We encourage a format that involves interactions and discussions beyond a \u201cmini-conference\u201d format (i.e., a series of paper presentations followed by Q&amp;A).&nbsp; The workshop, for example, can be organized in a seminar style, where attendees are invited to participate in the discussion of the papers in the workshop actively.&nbsp; Organizers may include, for example, break-out sessions, hands-on sessions, curated panels, or pro-contra discussions of reading lists. Workshops may also be organized as a combination of multiple formats.&nbsp; <strong>The organizers should clearly explain the proposed format of their workshop in the proposal.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-accent-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-66eb7f17c1cf43b23b7f2fac6570e2bd\">Publication Options<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Workshop organizers can choose one of two options regarding publication: (1) The workshop\u2019s papers will be published in ISMAR 2024 adjunct proceedings and IEEE Xplore (Accepted papers should be formatted using the <a href=\"https:\/\/tc.computer.org\/vgtc\/publications\/conference\/\">IEEE Computer Society VGTC format<\/a> and will be subject to the registration and publication processing policy of ISMAR 2024), or (2) The workshop\u2019s papers will not be published but will be distributed as supplemental material along with the ISMAR 2024 proceedings, as a part of the conference material.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-accent-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-57a263fe5bf238e1238942e01782ce47\">Submission Guidelines for Workshop Proposals<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Workshop submissions can be directed to <a href=\"mailto:workshop_chairs@ieeeismar.org\">workshop_chairs@ieeeismar.org<\/a> (please use the subject \u201cISMAR 2024 Workshop Proposal\u201c and cc all co-organizers on the email).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal should be submitted as a single PDF document containing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Title of the workshop.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Preferred date for the workshop:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>October 21st (Monday)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>October 25th (Friday)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>No preference<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Presentation mode:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Online or<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Physically in the Greater Seattle Area<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Themes and topics of interest:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Brief description of the research issues that the workshop will address.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reasons why the workshop is of interest to the conference participants.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reasons why the workshop is timely and relevant for ISMAR 2024.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Industrial interest (optional).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Format of the workshop (including a rudimentary agenda).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Whether workshop materials should be published in the proceedings.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Organizers (having two organizers for a workshop is the minimum requirement):\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Names.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Affiliations.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Research interest.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Short bio.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Potential program committee members.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Audience: approximate the expected number of participants and submissions (range)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Call for participation document.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A template for the workshop proposal can be found here: <a href=\"https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/ISMAR_2024_Workshop_Proposal_v3.docx\" data-type=\"attachment\" data-id=\"348\">Proposal Template<\/a>.<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers (a minimum of two organizers per workshop) are expected to be proactive in the field where they propose a workshop.
