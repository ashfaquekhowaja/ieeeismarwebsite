Together, let\u2019s chart a course towards a resilient and technologically enriched future, ensuring sustainable growth for the Metaverse ecosystem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year\u2019s theme is \u201cNavigating the Virtual Frontier\u201d. ISEMV 2024 will be a full-day in-person event on Monday, October 21, co-located with the<strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/\">23rd IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR)<\/a><\/strong>&nbsp;in Bellevue in the greater Seattle area, US. ISEMV 2024 will consist of invited speakers, panels, and oral presentations of peer-reviewed papers, poster presentations, and a competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>General Information<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Metaverse represents a forthcoming era of profound technological integration, where the boundaries between physical reality, digital worlds, human presence, and artificial intelligence blur into a harmonious fusion. This vision promises a seamless blend of personal and professional spheres, reshaping industries, economies, education, and society at large. As we traverse the landscape of digital evolution, the prospect of the Metaverse becoming an indispensable part of our lives grows ever nearer, promising enriched interactions and connectivity on a global scale. Yet, the journey toward this transformative future is hindered by open research questions and challenges, ranging from technological limitations and economical barriers to the need for setting global standards, and ethical frameworks. Tackling these complexities demands concerted efforts from the global research and development community. Only through collaborative endeavors can we propel the frontier of innovation forward, overcoming barriers, and realizing the full potential of the Metaverse to shape our collective destiny.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ISEMV 2024 invites authors to submit papers and posters for oral (in person) presentation at the Symposium, and publication on IEEE Xplore. Papers should not exceed 4 pages, encompassing tables, figures, and references, while posters should adhere to a maximum of 2 pages, inclusive of all elements. All submissions must be original and should not be concurrently under review elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>*Refer to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/ieee-isemv.org\/call-for-papers\/submission-guidelines\/\">submission guidelines<\/a>&nbsp;for more details.&nbsp;<strong>All accepted 4-page papers and 2-page posters presented at ISEMV will be included in IEEE Xplore.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ISEMV seeks original, high-quality contributions that address diverse aspects of the Metaverse.
