While these terms are often used interchangeably or ambiguously, their original meanings and intended distinctions are frequently overlooked. As the field continues to grow, it is critical for academic and professional communities to revisit and clarify the definitions, applications, and historical development of these terms. This panel aims to provide an in-depth discussion on the origins, evolution, and current usage of VR, AR, MR, and related terminologies. By engaging experts from various backgrounds, the session will explore the semantic nuances and historical contexts that have shaped the adoption and interpretation of these terms. The goal is to foster a shared understanding within the community, encouraging consistent and precise communication of concepts. Through this dialogue, we hope to address existing misconceptions and establish a common language that accurately reflects the advancements and diversity of immersive technologies. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Panelists: <br>Mark Billinghurst (University of South Australia) <br>Takeshi Kurata (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)) <br>Missie Smith (Auburn University) <br>Wolfgang Broll (TU Ilmenau) <br><br>Facilitator: <br>Kiyoshi Kiyokawa (Nara Institute of Science and Technology)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Time: 16:00-17:30 Date: October 23rd, 2024, Wednesday Place: King County 1, 2, 3 Abstract: The rapid evolution and proliferation of immersive technologies have led to the widespread use of diverse terminologies, including Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR), Extended Reality (xR), and XR.
