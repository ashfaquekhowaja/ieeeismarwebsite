Accepted students will be expected to give in-depth presentations of their research and will receive valuable comments from mentors. Additionally, accepted students will create a poster to share their work with ISMAR \u201924 Doctoral Consortium and general conference attendees. Accepted students will have the option to publish their two-page extended abstract in the conference proceedings and to be included in the ISMAR 2024 online program. Abstracts may be archived in the IEEE Xplore digital library.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-accent-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-8942dd5365d1a3914a4b6d6da3247a52\">Important Dates<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Sunday June 9th 2024 23:59 AoE <\/strong>&#8211; Submission Deadline<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li> <strong>Monday<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>July<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>15th<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>2024<\/strong><strong> 23:59 AoE <\/strong>&#8211; Notification of Acceptance<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li> <strong>Wednesday July 31st 2024 23:59 AoE <\/strong>&#8211; Camera-ready Submission<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-accent-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-d2cc0f66cd00d444504f077381360bf4\">Eligibility and Topics<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideal candidates will be in the early or mid-stage of their PhD and should have a solid idea of their research direction as well as dissertation topic, which may have still room for improvement.
