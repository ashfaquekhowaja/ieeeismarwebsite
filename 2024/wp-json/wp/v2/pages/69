ISMAR is responding to the recent explosion of commercial and research activities related to <strong>AR,<\/strong> <strong>MR <\/strong>and <strong>VR<\/strong> by continuing the expansion of its scope over the past several years. ISMAR 2024 will cover the full range of technologies, from interfaces in the real world to fully immersive experiences. This range goes far beyond the traditional published work in AR, such as precise 3D tracking, visual display, and real-time performance. We specifically invite contributions that advance all aspects of AR \/ MR \/ VR technology and user experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-accent-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6735487476f6d8d2f691253cb0923a0e\">Journal Papers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Accepted papers within the journal track will be published in a special issue of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note, this year, the conference track will run partly in parallel with the journal track.
