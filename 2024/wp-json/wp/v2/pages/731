The vision of always-on AI-assisted AR that can be used in a continuous fashion for an entire day depends on solving many difficult problems including display technology, computing power, batteries, localization, tracking, and contextual sensing, in addition to delivering the multimodal AI models to power the inference and assistance. However, to deliver truly useful all-day mobile AI+AR experiences, we must solve the fundamental problem of how to effectively interact with this technology that goes beyond just speaking to it. The solution to the interaction problem requires that we invent novel sensing and haptic technologies for all-day wearable devices as well as leverage the ever more powerful contextual AI understanding to yield truly frictionless and expressive experiences. In this talk, I will cover the recent advances in this research area from Meta Reality Labs Research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><strong>Speaker Bio:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\"><div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/2024-Benko-Hrvoje-0140BarbieHull-1-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-752\" style=\"width:300px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/2024-Benko-Hrvoje-0140BarbieHull-1-819x1024.jpg 819w, https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/2024-Benko-Hrvoje-0140BarbieHull-1-240x300.jpg 240w, https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/2024-Benko-Hrvoje-0140BarbieHull-1-768x960.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/2024-Benko-Hrvoje-0140BarbieHull-1-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/2024-Benko-Hrvoje-0140BarbieHull-1-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/2024-Benko-Hrvoje-0140BarbieHull-1-scaled.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" \/><\/figure><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Hrvoje Benko is a Director of Research Science at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/research.fb.com\/category\/augmented-reality-virtual-reality\/\">Meta Reality Labs Research<\/a>&nbsp;where he is developing novel interactions, devices and interfaces for Contextualized AI, Augmented and Virtual Reality.

However, while these technologies have now been made available, mixed reality systems are still struggling to convey compelling haptic sensations for 3D interaction.<br>The talk presents some of our latest contributions exploring the design of haptic interaction techniques within mixed environments. The talk will illustrate the use of haptic technologies through the different components of the 3D interaction loop, from perceptual considerations to algorithmic implementation, through the design of innovative haptic interfaces as well as 3D interaction metaphors. At the end, the talk aims at introducing some of the next challenges in Mixed Reality for enhancing 3D interaction through the use of multimodal haptic feedback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Speaker Bio:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"913\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/MMarchal_Photo-2-913x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-735\" style=\"width:300px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/MMarchal_Photo-2-913x1024.png 913w, https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/MMarchal_Photo-2-268x300.png 268w, https:\/\/ieeeismar.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/MMarchal_Photo-2-768x861.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>Maud Marchal is a Full Professor in Computer Science at Univ.
