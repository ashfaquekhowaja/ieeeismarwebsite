We are looking for inspirational panels to be held at the IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR) 2025, from October 8 to 12, 2025.

IEEE ISMAR is the premier conference for Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR). ISMAR explores the advances in commercial and research activities related to AR, MR and Virtual Reality (VR).

This year, according to ISMAR conference guidelines, all panelists must be in-person.

Panel proposals should be submitted electronically to panels_chairs@ieeeismar.net by June 24th, 2025 and should include:
A title for the panel session
A brief description of the overall issues to be discussed (500 words or less)
The names, contact information, and short (100 words or less) biographies for the organizer and each panelist. Panelists should come from multiple organizations. Panelists from industry may be eligible for a complimentary one-day registration. Other panelists and the moderator should register normally.
A confirmation that all panelists can participate in-person
We will publish a one page description of the panel in the ISMAR adjunct proceedings.

For more information and inquiries, please contact the Panels Chairs at panels_chairs@ieeeismar.net.
