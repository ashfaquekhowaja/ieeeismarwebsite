## Overview

ISMAR 2025 will host **a single track for papers** and include a **revise and resubmit phase**, strengthening the rebuttal opportunity.

ISMAR 2025 will cover industry and research activities related to the full range of immersive technologies (AR, MR, and VR), including everything from interfaces in the real world to fully immersive experiences, and beyond. This range goes far beyond the traditional published work in AR, such as precise 3D tracking, visual display, and real-time performance. We specifically invite contributions that advance all aspects of AR / MR / VR technology and user experiences.

## Paper Submissions

This year, there is **one submission deadline for a unified review process for both the IEEE TVCG journal and the conference** only papers. The possible outcomes of this unified process are:

- Accept as IEEE TVCG paper, with presentation at ISMAR 2025
- Accept as IEEE ISMAR 2025 conference paper, with presentation
- Recommend as IEEE ISMAR 2025 poster
- Reject

Submissions accepted as journal papers will be directly published in a special issue of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). Submissions accepted as conference papers will be published in the conference proceedings of ISMAR 2025. All accepted papers will be archived in the IEEE Xplore digital library and will be subject to the registration and publication processing policies of ISMAR 2025.

Submissions may be 4-9 pages with an additional 2 pages of references. Note that a **paper abstract must be uploaded** prior to the actual paper submission deadline (see submission deadlines below). All paper submissions must be in English and left blind for review. The accepted papers will also be granted an oral presentation during the conference and will have the opportunity to present as a demo if desired.

The review process will consist of two review cycles. The result of the **first review cycle** determines if a submission is eligible for a **revision and resubmission.** This means submissions that are eligible for a revision can clarify issues raised by reviewers directly in a revised version of the submission, but this does not **guarantee acceptance.** The **second review cycle** consists of a short **re-review of the revisions** by reviewers and leads to a final recommendation.
