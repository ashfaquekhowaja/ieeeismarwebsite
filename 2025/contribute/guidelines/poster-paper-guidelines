ISMAR 2025 features two tracks for poster papers:

- **Poster papers:** These are directly submitted as posters.
- **Papers accepted/recommended as poster papers:** These were originally submitted as papers and accepted/recommended as poster papers, as the outcome of the review process.

All submissions must be done electronically via [PCS](https://new.precisionconference.com/user/login?society=ismar). A complete submission, including the paper and supplementary files, should be made before the deadline. See the [Call for Poster Papers](https://www.ieeeismar.net/2025/contribute/posters/) for specific dates.

## Formatting 

- All submissions should be formatted as ISMAR Conference Proceedings papers, using the IEEE Computer Society VGTC format described [here](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/).
- Poster papers use a double-blind reviewing process. Thus, authors, affiliations, and acknowledgments must not be mentioned in the submitted paper, videos, or supplementary materials.
- All submissions must be in English.


### Page Length  

- Poster papers must **not exceed 2 pages**, including references.
- Papers accepted/recommended as poster papers must be **shortened to a maximum length of 4 pages**, including references.
- Please note that ISMAR considers poster papers of **3 or more pages to be archival**. This means that authors of poster papers with 3 or more pages cannot resubmit longer versions of their accepted work at later ISMAR conferences.
