title: Standardization Committee
---

## Establishment Purpose

This committee has been established to strengthen the continuous collaboration between academic activities, such as ISMAR, and standardization activities, with the goal of enhancing the value of both. Through these activities, we also aim to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Initially, the committee will operate as a sub-organization under the ISMAR conference committee. As the committee gains momentum, we plan to evolve into a sustainable organization within ISMAR.

## Scope of Activities

The standardization committee will focus on the following activities (including but not limited to):

- Planning workshops and themed sessions
- Call for proposals and issues related to standardization
- Organizing competitions
- Promoting specific projects related to standardization
- Liaison activities with standardization organizations such as ISO/IEC

## Target Audience

- Academics and researchers who wish to expand and elaborate their research by gaining insights from standardization and industrial applications.
- Industry professionals and innovators who wish to contribute to the development of industry standards necessary for practical work while gaining exposure to the latest practical research presented at ISMAR.
- Participants in standardization organizations who wish to gain knowledge of academic breakthroughs, the current state of prototype system implementations, and evaluation results in real-world scenarios at ISMAR to make their standards and standardization activities more beneficial.
